# OVERBREWED
In Progress: A cafe spin on Overcooked

## Description
As a busy barista in this fast-paced cafe game, you must complete as many orders as possible in under two minutes. 
* Customer choices: Each order may ask for whole, almond, or oat milk (top-to-bottom in cafe view) and sugar/no sugar
* Controls:
  * E - Pick up items
  * P - Pour milk into the mug (need to bring milk bottle close enough to mug!)
  * b - Add espresso to complete the order
* Gamplay loop: Once an order is ready, place the mug on the counter and continue brewing as fast as possible until time runs out

Note: Scoring logic still in progress!
